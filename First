   <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p>Welcome. This is the ongoing web page created by Josh Dennis to learn and play around with coding.</p>
  <h3>History</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>January 10th, 2017: Creation of document and beginning of coding.</li>
   </ol>
 <p>Whew, it took awhile to work out, but I finally figured out why my entire doc was a header. Turns out it’s because I typed < h / 1 > instead of < / h 1 > </p>
 <h2>Shout out to <a href=“https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea”>This HTML Validator <3<3<3 </a> </h2>
 <p>Whewwwww!That was kinda just an excuse to do a hyperlink. Pretty fun though. I’m gonna try a button.</p>
